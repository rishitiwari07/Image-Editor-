In this project (Image Editor in JavaScript), as you’ve seen in the preview image, users can apply different filters to their image like grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjust the image brightness. Additionally, users can also rotate or flip the images and save their edited images.

So, I want to suggest you build some JavaScript projects before continuing to create this image editor. But, if you’re familiar with JavaScript, the codes and logic of this project shouldn’t be difficult to understand for you.

Canvas part of the codes could be difficult to understand for you and canvas is used only to save the edited image. So, please watch the above video multiple times to understand the codes because I tried my best to explain the main JavaScript lines with written comments.
